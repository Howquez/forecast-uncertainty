                        Procedure
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can win a bonus payment of {{ Constants.bonus }} € in this study. To qualify for that bonus,
                        you will have to make 6 trade-offs twice. Subsequently, we will ask you some questions about
                        yourself. Finally, we will show you how much money you earned in this study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole study will take about 25 minutes of your time. Reading the instructions accounts for
                        approximately 10 minutes while the participation in the study, that is, the trade-offs as well
                        as the questionnaire take about 15 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each trade-off consists of two options: a bet on the weather as well as a lottery.
                        To better assess the weather situation, you will receive information about previously measured
                        temperatures. For the time being, you will not know anything about the location or the time the
                        weather information refers to. After making the first 6 trade-offs, you will receive additional
                        information. More precisely, you will be exposed to a weather forecast that you can then use to
                        make the same 6 trade-offs once more.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text mb-0 lead">
                        Bet
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will ask you to bet on certain temperatures. You may bet that the temperature will be at
                        least 17°C on a certain day at 14:00 (CET). If the temperature turns out to be 17°C or higher,
                        you can earn {{ Constants.bonus }} €.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bet corresponds to the same time and location in each of the trade-offs. The only difference
                        between the trade-offs is the temperature interval you can bet on. As a consequence, one
                        trade-off may consider a temperature of 17°C or more, while another trade-off involves a bet on
                        the temperature being 8°C or less. For this reason, we advice you to carefully examine the
                        bets' temperature intervals that can earn you the bonus.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To better understand the lottery you can imagine an urn containing 100 colored balls. Some of
                        the balls are colored green, the others are red. Drawing a ball randomly and blindly, you can
                        earn {{ Constants.bonus }} € if the ball turns out to be green and nothing if the ball is red.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yo have to decide unter which conditions you prefer the lottery over the bet. We'll therefore
                        ask you how many of the abovementioned 100 balls have to be green such that you prefer the
                        lottery.
                    </p>
